\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Earning a Ph.D. degree would be an impossible journey without the support of professors, peers and loved ones. Here, I would like to thank a few of the ones that supported me over the four years of my Ph.D. and beyond. My first and deepest gratitude goes to Prof. Friedemann Mattern. His pioneering work on the Internet of Things inspired me profoundly and his guidance, support and interest in my research were great sources of motivation.

Even if this thesis reflects my views and research, it is the outcome of a collaborative effort. Instrumental to this thesis were the fruitful collaborations with Erik Wilde at UC Berkeley and in particular with Vlad Trifa at ETH Zurich. Vlad and I shared the most creative (and often funniest!) moments. Over the years, he became one of my closest friends and his support was key to my success. Thanks Vlad! 

I had the chance to split my Ph.D. time between research at ETH and SAP Research Zurich where further collaborations and friendships emerged. At ETH for example, learning the art of user studies with my office-mate and friend Iulia Ion or working with Simon Mayer and his unlimited creativity for Web of Things prototypes. I also heartily want to thank my other colleagues at ETH: Robert Adelmann, Alexander Bernauer, Christian Beckel, Philipp Bolliger, Steve Hinske, Wilhelm Kleiminger, Matthias Kovatsch, Marc Langheinrich, Benedikt Ostermaier, Matthias Ringwald, Christof Roduner, Kay R\"{o}mer, Silvia Santini, G\'{a}bor S\"{o}r\"{o}s and Markus Weiss. I further want to extend my gratitude to all the students who contributed, piece by piece, to building the Web of Things as we present it in this thesis: Azu Aguilar, Bettina Dober, Mathias Fischer, Soojung Hong, David Karam, Mathias Mueller, Lukas Naef and Thomas Pham.

At SAP, I would first like to thank the SOCRADES and SENSEI team-members for our collaborations: Oliver B\"{a}cker, Markus Eurich, Stefan Haller, Stamatis Karnouskos, Moritz K\"{o}hler, Luciana Moreira S\'{a} de Souza, Frederic Montagut, Patrik Spiess, Domnic Savio and Claudia Villalonga. I also enjoyed the very spontaneous collaborations with Ivan Delchev, Felix von Reischach and Andreas Budde. I extend my thank you to all friends and colleagues from SAP Research and especially to my manager Uli Eisert for his valuable support.

I found a significant source of inspiration for my thesis in the world of product identification and RFID. Hence, I am thankful to Prof. Elgar Fleich and his team for letting me the chance to work as a research associate of the Auto-ID labs in Zurich for more than a year. Furthermore, I want to express my deepest gratitude to Prof. Sanjay Sarma and his team who welcomed me at the MIT Auto-ID labs. They treated me as one of theirs from day one on and for the following six months of very inspiring discussions and fruitful collaborations.  

I was also lucky enough to be able to count on several mentors. In particular, Christian Floerkemeier whose guidance first at MIT and then ETH was truly valuable. His constant motivation, insights in the business of the Internet of Things and pragmatic view of research helped me to a level he probably does not suspect. Furthermore, I need to thank my two long-term mentors Olivier Liechti and Patrik Fuhrer whose guidance, sharp advices and jokes were always a source of pure motivation. I also want to thank Jacques Pasquier, Hans Gellersen and Beat Hirsbrunner for their very valuable advices and support at several important steps of my career.

Building a community while working on this thesis was a tremendous experience and I would like to heartily thank all the contributors, community members and readers of the Web of Things blog\footnote{See \url{www.webofthings.org}} as well as all the organizers, PC members and participants of the WoT workshop series\footnote{See \url{www.webofthings.org/wot}}.

Last but not least I want to express my deepest gratitude to my family: my sister and best friend V\'{e}ronique, my brother-in-law Steven, and to the rest of the family for their tremendous love and support over the years. To Rachel who, thanks to her love, patience and support, was the best partner a Ph.D. student could dream of. To my mother who always believed in me and motivated me to study. To my father Jean-Pierre whose humbleness, patience, dedication and taste for all things computers were and will always be a model for me. Thank you.
