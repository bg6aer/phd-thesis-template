phd-thesis-template
===================

A template for a PhD thesis based on my own thesis ([The Web of Things Application Architecture] (http://www.webofthings.org/2011/12/01/phd-web-of-things-app-archi/)).
It's obviously not here for you to copy its content (not really a good way of earning your PhD ;-)) 
but just to provide an idea of structure as well as a template with a nice look-and-feel...
Note that I removed all the figures from the source to make it lighter. 

If you do use it for your own thesis the only thing I ask you to do is to reference the template with at least a link
back to here, so that others get to know it and use it!

# Installing it
Install tex and latex as well as the following two packages:
* texlive-pictures 
* texlive-latex-extra

# Compiling the thesis
Run:
```bash
./compile-thesis.sh
```
with either of the following options:
* compile: compiles the whole thesis.
* compile-clean: cleans all the files and compiles the whole thesis.

Enjoy!
